It is a research-led \nUniversity in Dubai that draws on top-ranking British teaching and research \nto create a beacon for knowledge-led innovation in the Gulf region.\n\nIt opened in September 2004 with Institutes of Engineering, Education and \nInformatics and Master programmes in Education, Information Technology and \nProject Management. It is now creating the Institute of the Built \nEnvironment in association with Cardiff University and will shortly be \nannouncing a new Finance Institute, each with Masters programmes and \nresearch.\n\n-----------\nObjectives\n-----------\n\nA distinctive and innovative University, the British University in Dubai \nincludes among its objectives:\n\n\u00b7 To offer the highest international competitive level of research-informed \neducation in key modern disciplines\n\u00b7 To develop leading edge research capabilities in key disciplines\n\u00b7 To interact with regional industry/education and play a role in \nstimulating a knowledge-based economy in the region\n\n-----------\nPathway\n-----------\n\nThe pursuit of these objectives is being accelerated through close \nconnections with the highest rated UK Departments within selected leading \nuniversities in the UK.  These are departments graded 5 and 5* in the most \nrecent Research Assessment Exercise, verifying their achievement of \ninternational excellence.  BUiD is a research-led British University in the \nGulf region.  To date, BUID's partners are the Universities of Birmingham, \nCardiff, Edinburgh and Manchester.\n\nEven as it utilises connections with UK higher education, BUiD will develop \nin alignment with strategic planning for the Gulf region, in particular the \nDubai 2010 strategic plan and Dubai's ongoing review of educational \nprovision.\n\n---------------------------------\nThe Institute of Informatics\n---------------------------------\n\nThe Institute of Informatics stands for developing high quality research in \nareas that are vital for developing the knowledge economy in this region \nnamely: language, health, and business. Areas of expertise within the \nInstitute are speech and language engineering, machine learning (including \ndata mining), knowledge engineering, and multi-agent systems.\n\n--------------------------------------------\nRelationship with the University of Edinburgh\n--------------------------------------------\n\nProgrammes, which are delivered in Dubai, are based on current provision at \nthe University of Edinburgh, in the 5* School of Informatics, which is \nhighly respected internationally. All current staff of the Institute of \nInformatics have been awarded Honorary Fellowships by the School of \nInformatics at the University of Edinburgh.\n\n-------------\nProgrammes\n-------------\n\nThe Masters in Information Technology (MSc-IT) has two streams or \nspecializations: Speech and Language Engineering (SLE) and Knowledge and \nData Management (KDM).  The curriculum content is based on existing \nprovision at the University of Edinburgh, and is composed of the following \nmodules:\n\nIntroduction to Artificial Intelligence (core)\nWeb Design Project (core)\nKnowledge Representation\nLearning from Data\nApplied Databases\nData Mining and Exploration\nSpeech Processing (SLE)\nIntroduction to Computational Linguistics (SLE)\nKnowledge Engineering (KDM)\nKnowledge Management (KDM)\n\nThe streams are developed further through coursework and the dissertation. \nProgramme content, structure, assessment and quality assurance is based on \nand to all intents and purposes is the same as that of Edinburgh.\n\nThe Institute is introducing a new programme, the Masters in Information \nTechnology Management, which is in partnership with the Institute of \nEngineering. The programme is designed to provide training in advanced IT \nand advanced Project Management and includes the following modules:\n\nIT Modules\n- Knowledge Management\n- Data Mining and Exploration\n- Applied Databases\n- Web Design Project\n\nProject Management Modules\n- Strategy\n- Planning and Resource Management\n- Cost and Value Management\n- People and Culture\n\nUpon completion of the taught modules, a student engages in a dissertation \nproject, which is linked to the research interests of the staff or could be \nproposed by the student based on his or her research interests.\n\n----------------------- \nThe Senior Lectureship\n-----------------------\n\nThe Institute of Informatics wants to hire a senior lecturer in IT \nManagement (or a related area) to boost its research and teaching in that \narea. He or she would also be appointed as the programme coordinator and \ndissertation coordinator for the new IT Management programme.\n\nThe person will be resident in Dubai.

My\nmachine at home is an AMD64 box. I have Python 2.5 installed, which is 64\nbits on Windows x64.\n\nOn a normal Unix box an egg for a 32 bits system will result in something\nlike Genshi-0.5dev_r847-py2.5-linux-i686.egg. On an 64-bits system we get\nGenshi-0.5dev_r847-py2.5-linux-x86_64.egg. This distinction is important\nsince Genshi includes a _speedups.so which is compiled to either 32 or\n64-bits.\n\nOn a 64-bits Windows it will always create an egg with win32 in the name. So\nboth a 32-bits and 64-bits Python will in the end create an egg with win32.\nSo imagine creating a 64-bits egg with compiled _speedups and putting it on\nPyPI. Any 32-bits Python requesting Genshi will get the egg with 64-bits\ncompiled binaries in it. I think it's obvious this is Not Good(tm). (I\nalready raised the issue on distutils-sig, but it has remained unanswered\nthus far.)\n\nSo from what I gather we have no unique way to refer to 32-bits or 64-bits\nPython aside from the semi-adequate platform.architecture()[0].\n\n-- \nJeroen Ruigrok van der Werven  / asmodai\n\u30a4\u30a7\u30eb\u30fc\u30f3 \u30e9\u30a6\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30af \u30f4\u30a1\u30f3 \u30c7\u30eb \u30a6\u30a7\u30eb\u30f4\u30a7\u30f3\nhttp://www.in-nomine.org/ | http://www.rangaku.org/ | GPG: 2EAC625B\nBe yourself is all that you can do.\n_______________________________________________\nPython-Dev mailing list\nPython-Dev@python.org\nhttp://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev\nUnsubscribe: http://mail.python.org/mailman/options/python-dev/python-dev%40tangomu.com\n\n", "response": "{\n  \"is_phishing\": false,\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.95,\n  \"threat_type\": \"none\",\n  \"risk_level\": 0,\n  \"indicators\": [],\n  \"mitigation_recommendations\": {\n    \"immediate_actions\": [],\n    \"preventive_measures\": [],\n    \"reporting_guidance\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"analysis_summary\": \"The email is a normal technical reply from a Python developer mailing list, with no malicious content or phishing indicators.\"\n}", "label": 0, "model": "gpt-oss:20b", "provider": "ollama", "quality_score": 0.9700000000000001, "confidence": 0.95, "is_valid": true}

But what's the best way to run enterprise Java applications \non a virtualization platform like VMware ESX Server? And what do you need to \nmake that vital connection between virtualization and SOA for real-life data \ncenter operations? \n\nBEA's unique LiquidVM(TM) Java virtual machine technology allows enterprise \nJava applications to run directly on hypervisor-based virtualization \nplatforms. With BEA WebLogic Server\u00ae Virtual Edition, you get a Java EE \nenvironment optimized to get the most out of virtualized hardware. And you \ncan even use LiquidVM to turn your own Java applications into virtual \nappliances. Streamlined deployment and unique memory management optimization \nmean more applications per server, reduced operations costs and more \nflexible, responsive IT. \n\nBut that's not all - BEA WebLogic Operations Control provides a policy-based \nmonitoring and resource allocation framework for managing ANY Java \napplication in virtual or non-virtualized environments. Together BEA \nWebLogic Server Virtual Edition and BEA WebLogic Operations Control provide \nan enterprise grade application virtualization solution that will be the \nmodel for tomorrow's virtual data center. \n\nWant to know more? \nDownload a copy of the BEA WebLogic Operations Control - Application \nVirtualization for Enterprise Java whitepaper now at: http://response.bea.com/forms/WWWWW_JAVA-VIRTU-LOC_XX_WP_09FB?tg=WWWWW.WLSBet_LogicEM1UN.XX.WP.EM.09FB.X.RES&elq=9F277DA844794342A71B60615821D531\n\n\nBest regards, \nBEA Systems, Inc. \n\n======================================================================\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nTo find out more about BEA's enterprise Java Virtualization technologies,\nwhere you will find white papers, downloads and online TCO Calculator that \nwill let you investigate the potential cost savings associated with a \nvariety of virtualization architectures, please click here:\n\nhttp://www.bea.com/virtualization/?tg=WWWWW.WLSBet_LogicEM1UN.XX.WP.EM.09FB.X.RES&elq=9F277DA844794342A71B60615821D531\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 1995-2008 BEA Systems, Inc.

Information Sciences on \"Chance Discovery: Extraction and Explanation of Events for Decisions\"\n- body: Dear colleagues,\n\nAfter the long interval, we obtained a new opporunity for publication\non chance discovery. Please feel free to circulate this message to\nyour colleagues, and to ask me any simple (hope not complex...)\nquestion.\n\nLooking forward to seeing your contacts/submissions,\n- Yukio Ohsawa @ The University of Tokyo\n\n************\n\nCall for Papers:\nSpecial issue from Information Sciences Journal on\n\"Chance Discovery:  Extraction and Explanation of Events for Decisions\"\n\nGuest editor(s):\n Yukio Ohsawa, The University of Tokyo, oovcwd@q.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n and Katsutoshi Yada, Kansai University\n\n[Scope of Chance Discovery since 2000]\n\nSince our first international session in 2000,\na chance has been defined as an event or a situation, which is\nsignificant for the decision of human(s), in other words which\nprovides an uncertain opportunity/risk for human. Detecting and\nunderstanding such an\nevent is defined as chance discovery, i.e., discovery of a chance. In\nthis sense,\nthe discovery of a chance may be emphasized in contrast to discovery by\nchance. Because the essential aspect of a chance is that it can be a seed of\nnew and significant benefits/loss for human, the sense of human about benefit\nand loss, as well as machine's power to analyze and visualizing data to human,\n is a ignificant factor for chance discovery.  The novel interests of\nbusiness people is focused on the dynamic behaviors of consumers and\nthe unpredictability of\nthe market, so that these people have been strongly encouraging the\n development of new tools for chance discoveries.\n\n Let us think about a tailor's question: \"customer X always buys a suit of 300\ndollars when he comes in. On the other hand, customer Y buys a suit of 2000\ndollars if he is very happy, but nothing if he is unhappy. To which customer\nshould I pay more attention?\" We can predict the behavior of customer X\neasily, but X's decision has nothing to do with the action of the\ntailor. On the\nother hand, if  customer Y comes in, the tailor should watch him in order to\ndecide what words he should choose in talking to Y and make him happy.\nIf X and Y come together, the tailor should focus all his attention to customer\nY. That is, the situation/event may be the more significant for human decision,\nthe less certain its future is. The target of chance discovery is such an event\nor a situation.\n\nIt is certainly important also for people in other domains (medical doctors,\npoliticians, military strategists, etc.) to build up strategies of\neffective actions by paying good attention to events of which the future is\nuncertain. These demands\nof human pushed us to present a new special issue on chance discovery.\n\nSince we started studies on this topic in 2000, ten of\ninternational/domestic workshops on chance discovery has been\norganized, 6 books has been published, and tens of user companies are\nintroducing the tool into their creative busines decisions. The\nprocess of\nchance discovery has been characterized in terms of (1) becoming aware\nof a chance (2) explaining its significance for humans, and (3) decide and\ndo  real actions. These steps may interleave each other, not necessarily\nrunning in the fixed order like  \"(1), (2), and then (3).\"  The basic models\nof this process will be a significant topic of this special issue.  Theories\nof cognition and creativity can be the core of this direction.\n\nThe elements of this overall process will be certainly important\nsubmissions.For example (impossible to count all), computer-aided detection\nand visualization of events on real data from the environment have been\nproven to contribute strongly and trustworthily to support step (1).\nCognitive aspects and supporting tools of human's expertise and\nhumans' communication are the  basis of (2). Furthermore, the real\ndata and human's\nconcerns with opportunities and risks are to be obtained from his/her\nactions in the real environment. All interactions of human, data,\nand the real world are linked to (3), and should be fed back to (1) and (2).\nAll in all, the interaction among human(s), computers, and\n the environment from all aspects are expected to form the core of this\nspecial issue.\n\nFor this special issue, we would like to select papers by organizing a fair\nreviewing team. The submissions we expect are from such domains as:\n\n- Humans collecting data, and computers challenging data:\n knowledge discovery and data mining/visualization,\n operation research, evidence extraction and link discovery\n- Complex dynamism of the real world: multi-agent system, evolutionary\ncomputing, physics, economic physics, mathematics,\n- Human's cognition of chances: Cognitive/brain science, and psychology,\n- Human group's thoughts and actions: social psychology, business\nadministration, risk management, group creativity support\n\nExpected topics to be discussed by the authors and the readers of the\npublication are:\n** Analysis of human behaviors.\n** Analysis of complex systems (society, community etc.).\n** Applications of chance discovery.\n** Philosophical characterization of ``chance.''\n** Logical foundations for chance discovery.\n** Computational theories and methods to discover rare/novel but\n  significant events.\n** Computational theories and methodologies to foretell next trends.\n** Cognitive theories on the awareness of significant events.\n** Cognitive and sociological theories for the evaluation and selection\n  of chance.\n** Management theories and methods for surviving on chance events in business.\n** Interactions between computer and users in data mining/visualization.\n\nIn the review process, we shall encourage reviewers to accept novel systems\nand ideas for chance discovery, as far as the paper presents a trustworthy\nmethods or theories for discovering chances which are useful for creating the\nfuture, in any context of human life.\n\nSubmission: Find authors guides for http://www.ees.elsevier.com/ins\n Each submission paper should not exceed 12 pages in the final version.\n Important Dates:\n-- 1 May, 2008: Submission deadline of papers\n-- 1 Aug, 2008: Notification of acceptance of papers.\n-- 1 Oct 2008: Deadline for revised papers\n\nReview:\nAll submissions will be reviewed on the basis of relevance, originality,\nsignificance, soundness and clarity. At least two referees will review each\nsubmission independently.\n\nContact person:\nYukio Ohsawa, Dr.\nAssociate Professor,\nOfficial address: oovcwd@q.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp\nSchool of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 113-8656 Japan\n\n\n", "response": "{\n  \"is_phishing\": false,\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.85,\n  \"threat_type\": \"none\",\n  \"risk_level\": 1,\n  \"indicators\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"sender email address\",\n      \"finding\": \"Gmail address used instead of official university domain\",\n      \"severity\": 2,\n      \"explanation\": \"The message claims affiliation with the University of Tokyo but the sender is w.enotbg@gmail.com, which is not a university domain.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"category\": \"subject line\",\n      \"finding\": \"Generic CFP format\",\n      \"severity\": 1,\n      \"explanation\": \"The subject follows a standard academic call\u2011for\u2011papers template, which is common for legitimate scholarly communications.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"category\": \"link authenticity\",\n      \"finding\": \"Elsevier URL\",\n      \"severity\": 1,\n      \"explanation\": \"The only link points to http://www.ees.elsevier.com/ins, a legitimate Elsevier domain used for conference submissions.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"mitigation_recommendations\": {\n    \"immediate_actions\": [\n      \"Verify the sender\u2019s affiliation by contacting the University of Tokyo\u2019s official email address listed in the body.\",\n      \"Check the conference website or contact the listed guest editors for confirmation.\"\n    ],\n    \"preventive_measures\": [\n      \"Maintain an updated list of legitimate conference and journal email domains.\",\n      \"Use email authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) checks to validate sender domains.\"\n    ],\n    \"reporting_guidance\": \"If any doubt remains, forward the email to the university\u2019s IT security team or the appropriate academic department\u2019s help desk.\"\n  },\n  \"analysis_summary\": \"The email appears to be a legitimate academic call for papers; the primary anomaly is the use of a Gmail address by the sender, which is uncommon but not definitive proof of phishing.

The\nonly hard rules are that the demo must show novel\ntechnology and must\nbe LIVE and INTERACTIVE!  (It is not a back-door\nPoster Session.)\n\nSubmitting a Demonstration proposal is online and very\neasy, see:\n\n*Demonstration Application Form\n*\n\nAct quickly because our final deadline is Sunday\nSeptember 25, 2005.\nDemonstrations proposers will be notified of\nacceptance by the first\nweek of October.\n\n*NIPS 2005 Demonstrations Co-Chairs: *Timmer Horiuchi,\nDept. of\nElectrical and Computer Engineering, Institute for\nSystems Research\nand the Neuroscience and Cognitive Science Program,\nUniversity of\nMaryland and Alan Stocker, Center for Neural Science,\nNew York\nUniversity. Questions should be directed to\ntimmer@isr.umd.edu.\n\n*Deadline for Demonstration Proposals:  September 25,\n2005*\n\nNIPS is a continually-evolving interdisciplinary\nConference, which\nattracts cognitive scientists, computer scientists,\nengineers,\nneuroscientists, physicists, statisticians, and\nmathematicians\ninterested in all aspects of neural and statistical\nprocessing and\ncomputation. The Demonstration Track enables\nresearchers to highlight\nscientific advances, systems, and technologies in ways\nthat go beyond\nconventional poster presentations. It will provide a\nunique forum for\ndemonstrating advanced technologies (hardware and\nsoftware), and\nfostering the direct exchange of knowledge.  We hope\nthat this track\nwill stimulate interactions between researchers from\ndifferent fields\nor approaches.\n\n*Key requirements for Demonstrations* is that they be\nLIVE and\nINTERACTIVE and that they present a compelling view of\nan emerging\ntechnology. Past Demonstrations have covered a very\nwide range.\nAreas of interest for the Demonstrations track have\npreviously\nincluded the following: analog and digital VLSI,\nneuromorphic\nengineering, computational sensors and actuators,\nrobotics, bioMEMS\n(microelectromechanical systems), biomedical\ninstrumentation, neural\nprostheses, RNA-computation, photonics, real-time\nmultimedia systems,\nlarge-scale neural emulators, online learning\nalgorithms, and\nopen-source software toolboxes.\n\n*Submissions* accepted in the Demonstrations track\nwill be published\non the NIPS web site, but will not appear in printed\nproceedings.\nHowever, submitting your work to the Demonstration\ntrack does not\npreclude the submission of a companion paper to the\nregular NIPS\nConference; joint submissions are very much\nencouraged.  We also\nencourage authors submitting Demonstrations to\nconsider organizing a\nWorkshop at NIPS 2005.\n\n*NIPS will provide: * There will be a separate room\nfor these\nDemonstrations and participants will have access to\npower strips,\ntables and poster boards. Monitors will also be\nprovided on request\nat their rental cost. Participants are responsible for\nensuring that\ntheir Demonstration is sufficiently portable;\nadditional hardware\nbeyond that specified above might be provided at cost,\nif readily\navailable.\n\nProposals for Demonstrations will be reviewed by the\nDemonstrations\nCo-Chairs.  Demonstration proposals should be\nsubmitted via the web\nform:\n\nDemonstrators will be asked to enter information about\nthe nature of\nthe Demonstration, in particular they will be asked to\ndescribe first\nthe user experience and then the underlying\ntechnology. Proposals\nthat are simply papers in disguise will be rejected,\nthis session is\nfor live, interactive experiences that compellingly\ndemonstrate new\ntechnology.  Proposers will also be asked about the\npresent state of\ntheir Demonstration in order that the co-chairs may\njudge whether the\nDemonstration can actually be made functional.  Past\nexperience has\nshown that simpler Demonstrations that make one point\nare usually\nmore interesting to attendees.  Complex Demonstrations\ninvolving\nmultiple technologies and partners have not been as effective.\n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\n\n\n", "response": "{\n  \"is_phishing\": false,\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.95,\n  \"threat_type\": \"none\",\n  \"risk_level\": 0,\n  \"indicators\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"sender domain mismatch\",\n      \"finding\": \"Sender uses a generic Yahoo email address instead of an official conference domain.\",\n      \"severity\": 1,\n      \"explanation\": \"The email originates from rdbh58koiruftm@yahoo.com, which is not a typical domain for NIPS conference communications.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"category\": \"outdated content\",\n      \"finding\": \"The email references NIPS 2005, but was sent in 2008.\",\n      \"severity\": 1,\n      \"explanation\": \"The date and conference year do not match, suggesting the email may be an old mailing list copy.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"mitigation_recommendations\": {\n    \"immediate_actions\": [\n      \"Verify the authenticity of the call for demos by checking the official NIPS website or contacting the listed co\u2011chairs via their institutional email addresses.\"\n    ],\n    \"preventive_measures\": [\n      \"Filter emails from generic domains for conference announcements unless verified.\",\n      \"Encourage recipients to confirm event details through official channels before responding.\"\n    ],\n    \"reporting_guidance\": \"If the email appears suspicious, report it to the institution's IT security team or to the conference organizers.\"\n  },\n  \"analysis_summary\": \"The email appears to be a legitimate conference announcement, albeit with a generic sender address and outdated year references.

These computational \nand communication advances allow researchers to simulate large and complex \nsystems of interactive agents in scales not dreamt-of a short time ago. \nAt the same time, these same resources represent sophisticated evolving \ncomputational substrates in which artificial societies (could) exist and \nwhere the science of memetics could be tested, developed and exploited.\n\nThis symposium will bring together researcher working at the cutting-edge \nof memetic theory as applied to artificial systems and societies. METAS \naim is to promote multidisciplinary studies and promote the best science \non memetics. \n\nSome of the themes covered by METAS are:\n\n* Fundamental concepts on memetics and theoretical frameworks for Memetics \n  (eg., evolutionary, cognitive, societal and computational mechanisms, etc)\n* Memetics as an evolutionary model of information transmission\n* Qualitative and Quantitative issues of memetics in artificial and natural \n  societies (eg. the impact of memes in the individual VS the society, etc)\n* Computer simulations of memetics systems and dynamics\n* The memetics nature of information processing in networks (in general) \n  and the Internet (in particular)\n* The memetics of software evolution\n* Memetics simulations in economy, marketing, policy-making, conflict \n  resolution, game playing\n* Memetics in artificial and natural problem solving, software engineering \n  and multi-agent systems.\n* Requirements for effective memetics systems (computational substrates, \n  communication mechanisms, etc)\n\nThis symposium will provide a unique opportunity for researchers in \nartificial intelligence, artificial life, robotics, cognitive science, \nbiologist, social sciences, political studies and distributed systems \nengineering to interact with memetic scientist and to share a forum for \ndiscussion. The symposium will also serve as a common publication outlet \nfor interdisciplinary research in these areas.\n\nThe papers collected in the symposium will be extended and fully reviewed \nand will be published after the symposium in a book (preliminary agreement \nwith the Natural Computation Series in Springer). The interdisciplinary \nprogramme committee will select the papers to be presented during the \nsymposium and will also advice on which papers should appear latter \n(in extended version) in the book.\n \nThe symposium will consist of 2 plenary talks, one on each of the two \nday of the symposium.  The symposium will continue with papers presentations \nwhere each author will be given the opportunity to speak to the audience \non his work.  The symposium will finish with a round-panel discussion in \nthe last day.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n\n01 Sept. 2004: Call For Papers \n31 Oct.  2004: Paper Submissions Deadline\n22 Nov.  2004: Paper Acceptance Notification Deadline\n17 Dec.  2004: Camera-ready Deadline \n14 Jan.  2005: Early registration deadline \n\n12-15 April 2005: AISB 2005 convention\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSUBMITTING A PAPER\n\nShort, self-contained papers, between 3-6 pages, should be emailed to both \nngjfoek.fnuawusoa@Nottingham.ac.uk and luyggm.egikykwly@Nottingham.ac.uk \nwith the SUBJECT: AISB 2005 Submission.

I said before that even\n4.0.62 (tagged as \"unstable\") is stabler than 4.0.1 (tagged as\n\"stable\"). \nI took a look to unstable hoping what I expected. The weird thing is\nthat 4.0.1 lacks a lot of features; konqueror still crashing with\nflash-plugin pages; konsole does not save options changed (cursor, font\nand other things); \"kicker\" is not viewable at all; plasmoids fail and\nrestart plasma (always without success...)\nMay I follow describing issues? I speak a poor English, but if I would\nexpress in my mother tongue, I would be more explicit. So, sorry. \n\nThat's the reason why I said yesterday I will wait to the D-Day: when\nall things I do with kde3, gnome, windowmaker, even Enlightenment 0.17!,\nI can do it with kde4. \n\nCheers,\nAOP.\n\n> \n> What we are experiencing here are the consequences of the evolution of \n> openSUSE.

Find out with a Free Psychic Love Reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAries:\u00a0An offhand comment by your partner causes you to react with anger. Before you say something you don't mean, give yourself a moment to cool down. You may be better off letting it go.\nTaurus:\u00a0Don't let petty jealousy get in the way of enjoying your time with your honey. Getting worked up over a minor flirtation with someone else isn't worth the fight. Their heart belongs to you.\nGemini:\u00a0You've been trying to juggle so many things lately that you're having trouble finding your focus. Set your worries aside and focus on the positive. A quiet night with your honey would be ideal.\nCancer:\u00a0If something doesn't feel right to you now, wait until you feel sure. Talking to your partner can help you sort out how you feel, and don't forget the importance of listening to your gut instinct.\nLeo:\u00a0Be on the lookout for someone who wants to cause trouble for you and your honey. If you see someone who's up to no good, let them know you won't stand for it and they'll back down.\nVirgo:\u00a0You're feeling a little restless, so get out and do some exploring today. Ask your honey to take you someplace you've never been. Next weekend, you can do the same for them.\nLibra:\u00a0Being generous with your honey is part of the fun of being in a couple. Why not surprise them with a little treat today? You don't have to spend a lot, just choose something with a personal meeting.\nScorpio:\u00a0Your days of struggle are coming to an end. Now you're feeling like you've been reborn as an even stronger version of yourself. Celebrate the good times to come with your loved one.\nSagittarius:\u00a0Your desire for your honey has been kicked up a few notches today. Start the evening early by sending them a flirtatious text message -- or even better, a racy camera phone shot!\nCapricorn:\u00a0Your sweetheart's been acting a little odd lately, and you're not sure why. Talking to a friend can help. They might be able to offer you a different perspective. Perhaps you're making something out of nothing.\nAquarius:\u00a0Right now you're craving privacy for you and your loved one. If you can't get it at home, make some plans to spend a night or two away. The destination isn't important, as long as you can be together.\nPisces:\u00a0The next few days will be a time of emotional upheaval. At times it will not be easy for you and your loved one, but when it's over, you'll feel stronger and more sure of your commitment than ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAstrology.com Special:\nLook out for 'Number One' with a free sample Numerology Personality Profile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Psychic Reading\nWill you ever find Mr. Right?

That \nseems a little bit odd, in that setuptools will at least need its \negg-info directory to get installed, and all of the people who'll be \nusing this initially will be using it precisely in order to have \nsupport for eggs...\n\nSo, it might be simpler all around to just clear up the \n\"controversy\".  To the best of my recollection, only MAL and MvL have \never objected on Python-Dev to the idea of supporting eggs.\n\nNote: I'm specifically segregating \"egg support\" from the topic of \nincluding setuptools or easy_install in the stdlib directly.  There \nare many legitimate reservations and open questions about the latter, \nincluding availability of volunteer support, choice of defaults, \nwhether to replace distutils with setuptools, etc. etc.  I recognize \nand respect the validity of those issues, which is precisely why I \nwithdrew setuptools from inclusion in Python 2.5.\n\nHowever, regarding support for eggs, my understanding is that there \nwere only two objections to eggs -- even at the time of the 2.5 \nsetuptools discussions.  And even though MvL objects to the idea of \neggs in *principle*, I didn't read his recent posts as objecting to \nhaving the bootstrap tool download and install eggs in \n*practice*.  (Although I hope he will clarify that stance one way or \nthe other.)\n\nThat leaves MAL, whose objections to PEP 365 centered on the API (he \nsaid he was \"+1 on the concepts being added to the stdlib, -1 on \nadding the module in its current state\").  Among other concerns, he \nwanted pkg_resources to be split into pkgutil and a new \"egglib\" \nmodule.  I don't have a problem with this in principle, if there were \na pkg_resources module that reconstituted the merged API.  (But there \nare some practical problems with that approach, such as trying to \nsplit namespace package support between two theoretically-unrelated modules.)\n\nI would guess, however, that MAL's issues with the pkg_resources API \nwould not apply to a bootstrap module whose sole purpose was to \ndownload eggs and put them on sys.path.  Or, perhaps he would object \n*more*, I don't know.  We could certainly ask him, though.  :)\n\nSo, was there anyone else you were counting towards \n\"controversy\"?  The only other person I recall objecting to \nsetuptools in any way on Python-Dev was effbot, and IIUC his \nobjections were practical/administrative re: supporting easy_install \nand setuptools, not to the idea of .egg support in general.\n\nIn summary, I think the controversy on Python-Dev regarding .egg \nsupport has actually been over for some time now.\n\n_______________________________________________\nPython-Dev mailing list\nzvllln-eum@python.org\nhttp://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev\nUnsubscribe: http://mail.python.org/mailman/options/python-dev/python-dev%40tangomu.com\n\n\n", "response": "{\n  \"is_phishing\": false,\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.95,\n  \"threat_type\": \"none\",\n  \"risk_level\": 0,\n  \"indicators\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"none\",\n      \"finding\": \"No suspicious elements detected\",\n      \"severity\": 0,\n      \"explanation\": \"The email contains legitimate discussion content, no links, attachments, or request for personal data\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"mitigation_recommendations\": {\n    \"immediate_actions\": [],\n    \"preventive_measures\": [],\n    \"reporting_guidance\": \"not applicable\"\n  },\n  \"analysis_summary\": \"This message is a legitimate Python-Dev mailing list thread about PEP 365, with no phishing indicators.\"\n}", "label": 0, "model": "gpt-oss:20b", "provider": "ollama", "quality_score": 0.9650000000000001, "confidence": 0.95, "is_valid": true}

I'd like to nominate Saturday across the board\n    as the day for PUGs to meet up in person, with Sunday geared more\n    towards an online collaboration day via IRC, where we can take care\n    of all the little things that got in our way of coding on Saturday\n    (like finalising/preparing/reviewing patches, updating tracker and\n    documentation, writing tests ;-).\n\n    For User Groups that are planning on meeting up to collaborate,\n    please reply to this thread on zvllln-eum@python.org and let every-\n    one know your intentions!\n\n    As is commonly the case, #python-dev on irc.freenode.net will be\n    the place to be over the course of each sprint weekend; a large\n    proportion of Python developers with commit access will be present,\n    increasing the amount of eyes available to review and apply patches.\n\n    For those that have an idea on areas they'd like to sprint on and\n    want to look for other developers to rope in (or just to communicate\n    plans in advance), please also feel free to jump on this thread via\n    python-dev@ and indicate your intentions.\n\n    For those that haven't the foggiest on what to work on, but would\n    like to contribute, the bugs tracker at http://bugs.python.org is\n    the best place to start.  Register an account and start searching\n    for issues that you'd be able to lend a hand with.\n\n    All contributors that submit code patches or documentation updates\n    will typically get listed in Misc/ACKS.txt; come September when the\n    final release of 2.6 and 3.0 come about, you'll be able to point at\n    the tarball or .msi and exclaim loudly ``I helped build that!'',\n    and actually back it up with hard evidence ;-)\n\n    Bring on the pizza and Red Bull!\n\n        Trent.\n_______________________________________________\nPython-Dev mailing list\nzvllln-eum@python.org\nhttp://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev\nUnsubscribe: http://mail.python.org/mailman/options/python-dev/python-dev%40tangomu.com\n\n\n", "response": "{\n  \"is_phishing\": false,\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.97,\n  \"threat_type\": \"none\",\n  \"risk_level\": 0,\n  \"indicators\": [],\n  \"mitigation_recommendations\": {\n    \"immediate_actions\": [\"Verify the sender\u2019s domain matches the mailing list domain; no action needed if verified.\"],\n    \"preventive_measures\": [\"Keep mailing list subscriptions up to date; use email filtering rules to block unknown senders.\"],\n    \"reporting_guidance\": \"If suspicious content appears, report to the mailing list administrator or IT security team.\"\n  },\n  \"analysis_summary\": \"The email appears to be a legitimate Python-Dev mailing list message about sprint weekends, with no malicious links or suspicious content.

So... works for IE, too. A disadvantage is that a huge host file can slow your system. An ad blocker is easier to configure and tweak.  AdBlock Plus works  quite well for Firefox and Thunderbird.  You can use wildcards so you  don't have to block each and every Doubleclick (for example) server, you  just block *doubleclick*. You can also block individual items.  For example, Jerry Pournelle's  site has an annoying animated blimp gif.... I used WebWasher for years.  It's a proxy server.  I bought a new PC and  changed from Win98SE to XP.  I must be a dolt because I couldn't get  WebWasher to work.  AdBlock Plus works... I don't use IE anyway. paul --  _____________________________________     http://remsset.com     For as long as I can remember I've had amnesia. _______________________________________________ FoRK mailing list http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork", "response": "{\n  \"is_phishing\": false,\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.92,\n  \"threat_type\": \"none\",\n  \"risk_level\": 0,\n  \"indicators\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"sender domain mismatch\",\n      \"finding\": \"The From address uses a domain (planit.com) that does not match the internal build system or known corporate domains.\",\n      \"severity\": 1,\n      \"explanation\": \"The email claims to be from a build report but the sender address appears unrelated, which is a common sign of spoofing, yet the content and headers show legitimate internal routing.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"category\": \"no malicious content\",\n      \"finding\": \"Body contains only automated build logs, no links or attachments.\",\n      \"severity\": 0,\n      \"explanation\": \"The message is purely informational and does not request credentials or contain executable payloads.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"mitigation_recommendations\": {\n    \"immediate_actions\": [\n      \"Verify the email against known internal build notifications.\",\n      \"Check the sender address against the organization\u2019s approved list.\"\n    ],\n    \"preventive_measures\": [\n      \"Configure email filters to flag unexpected sender domains for internal reports.\",\n      \"Educate users to ignore automated reports that contain suspicious sender addresses.\"\n    ],\n    \"reporting_guidance\": \"If the email is confirmed to be spoofed, report to the IT security team via the internal incident response portal.\"\n  },\n  \"analysis_summary\": \"The email appears to be an automated build failure report with no malicious intent.

I think it is much more like:\nPower of a theory = number of things it explains / (number * \"size\" of \nthings it needs to assume )\nWhere size is exponentially proportional to how much \"faith\" vs. \ntestable fact is involved.\n\nIn other words:\nPower of a theory = number of things it explains / (number of things it \nneeds to assume * how much of a leap of faith those are)\nGod is an infinite leap of faith.  You do the math.\n\nsdw\n>\n> I've pointed this out to him...  we'll see how he responds.

The scientist's opinions, beliefs, and \npreferences often guide his/her research, in some cases for good, in \nother cases for bad. Certainly, a scientist must be able to abandone \nhis/her prior beliefs when there is enough evidence, and this is usually \nthe case, but there are also many examples in which even great \nscientists have refused new ideas even for their whole lives.\n\n> According to Feyerabend, this was the crux of the difference between \n> Galileo and the RC Church,  Galileo pursuing beliefs regardless of their \n> wider consequences, with the Church considering the social and political \n> consequences of alternative cosmologies to the then official one.     \n> The Church was behaving rationally, given its position as an actor in \n> the world, in suppressing Galileo's new ideas.\n\nI have not read Feyerabend's work, but I think that the Galileo affair \nhad more to do with human conservatism (his theory contradicted several \npsychologic, \"scientific\", and theologic ideas deeply rooted in the \npeople of his age) than with an analysis of long-term social and \npolitical consequences. In any case, I apologize for the off-topic, I \nwould not like to start here a discussion about this subject.\n\nBest regards,\n   Javier D\u00edez\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nFrancisco Javier Diez              Phone: (+34) 91.398.71.61\nDpto.

Which Weka algorithm can perform this? I see it as a clustering problem where the peak should be at the center of each cluster.

Python 3.0 should not and must not\nhave backward compatibility cruft. It defeats the whole point of 3.0 and\ndevalues it to the point of uselessness. It's just plain silly to discuss\nit.\n\nWhat can be done is adding a future statement to 2.6 to make '' be identical\nto u'': 'from __future__ import unicode_strings' or such, but it doesn't\nremove the need to use 2to3. Really, use 2to3.\n\n\n> The new semantics of the keys operation means that keys() will work\n> like iterkeys() works now.

It may not matter in any of\nyour code, but I really suggest not relying on it. Use 2to3.\n\n-- \nThomas Wouters \n\nHi!

Not sure what problem you are talking to \nspecifically, but I guess you are asking for \"upgrade codes\"; there is\nalso upgrade codes and package codes.\n\nEach package file should have its own unique *package\u00dc code, mere \nrebuilding should generate a new one. msilib does that correctly.\nA package code code can be installed at most once on a system.\n\nRelated packages for the same software should share a *product* code.\nRebuilding should not change the package code (but might in msilib;\nI'd have to check). Again, installer enforces that a specific package\ncode can only be installed once on a system. Python assigns a\nseparate product code for each bug fix release. Product codes\nare most useful for uninstallation, e.g. to uninstall Python 2.5.1,\ndo\n\n   msiexec /x {31800004-6386-4999-a519-518f2d78d8f0}\n\nUse separate product codes if you want to allow for simultaneous\nversions.\n\nSubsequent versions of the same product should share an *upgrade*\ncode. MSI will check the Upgrade table, to see whether a package\nwith the same upgrade code (but a different product code) is\nalready installed, and if so, whether the version range matches.\nIf the installed product is newer, it will refuse to install the\nolder one. If the installed product is older, it will perform\nan \"upgrade installation\", which involves uninstalling the older\nversion (possibly on a file-by-file basis), and possibly\nmigrating the feature selections.\n\nPython uses a single upgrade code (until 2.5.2, which introduces\na separate upgrade code for Win64). It then uses version ranges\nto make 2.5.2 an upgrade of 2.5.1 and 2.5.0, but not of 2.4.2\n(say), essentially causing only one bug fix release per 2.5.x\nto be installed on the system, but allowing simultaneous\ninstallation of 2.5 and 2.4 (say). With 2.5.2, simultaneous\ninstallation of Win64 and Win32 releases on a single system becomes\npossible - which also requires to assign separate product codes\nto Win64, namely\n\n    2.5.2, Win32: 6b976adf-8ae8-434e-b282-a06c7f624d2f\n    2.5.2, Win64: 6b976adf-8ae8-434e-b282-a06c7f624d20\n\n> WiX is an excellent inspiration though - if a WiX example can be found for\n> something, it should be a significant help in implementing it via msilib.\n\nThe current challenge is merge modules: How can I merge the VC msm into\nthe Python MSI (including support for SxS).\n\nRegards,\nMartin\n_______________________________________________\nPython-3000 mailing list\nsmsbmo-9552@python.org\nhttp://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-3000\nUnsubscribe: http://mail.python.org/mailman/options/python-3000/python-3000%40tangomu.com\n\n\n\n", "response": "{\n  \"is_phishing\": false,\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.95,\n  \"threat_type\": \"none\",\n  \"risk_level\": 0,\n  \"indicators\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"sender domain\",\n      \"finding\": \"domain does not match typical Python mailing list domains\",\n      \"severity\": 1,\n      \"explanation\": \"The email is from qpnysl@v.loewis.de, whereas legitimate Python mailing list emails usually originate from python.org or python.org domains; however, the content and links are legitimate and no malicious payload is present.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"mitigation_recommendations\": {\n    \"immediate_actions\": [\n      \"Verify the email content against known mailing list archives\",\n      \"Confirm links by hovering to ensure they point to python.org\"\n    ],\n    \"preventive_measures\": [\n      \"Use email filtering rules to flag unfamiliar domains for review\",\n      \"Maintain an updated list of legitimate mailing list senders\"\n    ],\n    \"reporting_guidance\": \"If suspicious, report to your organization\u2019s security team or to python-security@python.org\"\n  },\n  \"analysis_summary\": \"This message appears to be a legitimate reply to the Python-3000 mailing list about MSI packaging.

I'm skeptical that it will be a better overall\nsolution than the current one - the main difference would be that, \nrather than me being the only one who can realistically change the\npackaging chain, it would be you who is the only one - which, in \nprinciple, would be fine with me.\n\nI believe you need deep inside knowledge of the MSI database format\nfor WiX, just as you do for using the automation API. I think I could\nlearn WiX fairly quickly after all these years of learning MSI in the\nfirst place. I think the WiX designers did right in tying WiX so close\nto the MSI data model, but it means that WiX makes package creation not\nsimpler - merely more productive for the experienced user (who I\nhesitate to call WiXers :-)\n\nIn any case, when you work with WiX, I'm sure you'll gain a lot of\nexpert knowledge on Windows packaging.

I've written more code than I'd like to admit that\nspits out errors of the form \"Method frumble() expected a joojoo or\ngeegee argument, but got a %s instead\". Using type(arg).__name__ omits\nthe module name, which can be ambiguous in some contexts (some apps\nhave lots of different but related classes with the same name defined\nin different modules). Using repr(type(arg)) makes the message ugly\n(and longer, which matter). Making it pretty requires something like\ntype(arg).__module__ + \".\" + type(arg).__name__ with an exception if\n__module__ is empty or '__builtin__' is usually not worth the code.

The point of\nadding the issue was that the SyntaxError should not be generated and\nthe import should do the right thing.\n\nn\n\nn\n_______________________________________________\nPython-3000 mailing list\nsmsbmo-9552@python.org\nhttp://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-3000\nUnsubscribe: http://mail.python.org/mailman/options/python-3000/python-3000%40tangomu.com\n\n\n", "response": "{\n  \"is_phishing\": false,\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.97,\n  \"threat_type\": \"none\",\n  \"risk_level\": 0,\n  \"indicators\": [],\n  \"mitigation_recommendations\": {\n    \"immediate_actions\": [],\n    \"preventive_measures\": [],\n    \"reporting_guidance\": \"No action required\"\n  },\n  \"analysis_summary\": \"The message appears to be a legitimate discussion from the Python-3000 mailing list about import syntax.

However, researchers in AI may not\nnecessarily be aware of database concerns and conversely, database\nresearchers may not always be aware of AI concerns and past\ncontributions. The Scalable Uncertainty Modeling conference aims to\nbring all those interested in the management of large volumes of\nuncertainty together, irrespective of whether they are in databases\nor in AI. Papers are solicited in all areas of massive uncertainty\nincluding, but not restricted to, the topics listed below.\n\n  * probability logic\n  * semantics of uncertain data\n  * formal models of uncertain data\n  * reasoning with inconsistent and uncertain information\n  * fuzzy logic\n  * annotated logic\n  * Bayesian models\n  * Markov models\n  * paraconsistent logic\n  * uncertain DB algebras\n  * query optimization with uncertainty\n  * spatio-temporal uncertainty\n  * caching for uncertain DBs\n  * uncertain DB calculi\n  * inconsistency management\n  * uncertainty and views\n  * indexing methods for uncertainty\n  * uncertain aggregate queries\n  * multimedia and uncertainty\n  * mobile uncertainty\n  * implementations\n  * applications\n  * vision and uncertainty\n  * audio processing and uncertainty\n  * commercial systems\n  * learning\n  * data mining\n  * data sharing and uncertainty\n  * approximate schema mapping\n\nThe proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer\nVerlag in their Lecture Notes in AI Series. Research papers of 14\npages maximum in the Springer Lecture notes in Computer Science\nformat (www.springer.com/lncs) are sought.\n\nImportant Dates:\nPaper submission: **** May 17, 2007 (11:59pm US Eastern time) ****\nPaper accept/reject decisions: July 10, 2007.\nCamera ready copies due: July 25, 2007.\n\nConference General Chair:\nDidier Dubois (Univ.

The first involves a hazardous road that has war at one end and peace at the other. The second concerns a rough, sweaty game that England might win. There will be some other stories worth paying attention to, but it is basically Iran and rugby tonight. \n \nIran's chief nuclear negotiator quits\n=====================================\n \nAli Larijani has resigned as Iran's chief nuclear negotiator. Your instant reaction is probably a yawning \"so what?\". But Larijani is important. He's the man who was probably more able than anyone in Iran to deliver an accommodation with the West over the nuclear issue and Iraq. He was urbane, intelligent and far from fundamentalist - you may remember him as the person who sorted out the release of the British sailors captured in the waterway between Iraq and Iran. \n\nDie hard Channel 4 News viewers will remember his live appearances on the programme complete with simultaneous translation. More importantly he was a man the West could deal with - much more so than his boss, the president. So it is a big loss, and one that could make the road to conflict in the region a little swifter. Tonight we will have something of an inside track on what happened between Larijani and President Ahmedinejad to bring events to this point. \n\nFor more on the Pakistan story: http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/international_politics/irans+chief+nuclear+negotiator+quits/941647\n \nEyes on the ball\n================\n \nWe will have the build up to the Rugby World Cup final, which kicks off at 8 o'clock. Tens of thousands of England fans have gone to Paris by train, plane, boat and automobile. There are even rumours of delays to scheduled flights because there are so many private jets heading across. Can the England team pull it off? We didn't really do rugby at my school, and I've never had cause to learn the rules since, so it is a good job that a man and woman better qualified than me to explain will be on the programme tonight.  \n \nIn other news: how America's air force managed to fly six armed nuclear missiles across the country without realising it, how the recommended drinking levels are something of a guess and the latest from Pakistan.\n \nPlus: Lewis Hamilton will have a qualifying time for the Grand Prix by the time we go on air, and we'll have the latest football results. \n \nChannel 4 News services\n====================\n\nOnline: Watch our video reports at: \nhttp://www.channel4.com/news/watchlisten/video/\n\nSubscribe to RSS feeds, podcasts and mobile phone bulletins. \nhttp://www.channel4.com/news/subscribe/\n\nBusiness\n============\n\nAt the time of sending the FTSE-100 index was 6527.9 \nThe US Dollar to Sterling was: .4874 \nThe Euro to Sterling was: .6972\n\n\nWeather\n==========\nSponsored by Worcester, Bosch Group - www.worcester-bosch.co.uk \n\nToday\nPatchy fog across some central areas will clear slowly, then all areas will be dry with some sunshine.
