      "answer": "To begin implementing continuous auditing for your cloud services, you should first identify the most critical risks your organization faces. Start by selecting a handful of metrics that address these risks. Consider your organization's maturity level and technical capabilities, as not all metrics may be immediately feasible to implement. Use the metrics catalog from the CSA Continuous Audit Metrics Working Group as a guide, focusing on metrics that align with your governance, risk management, and transparency objectives. Once you have selected the metrics, define the frequency of measurement based on the risk levels and set objectives for each metric. Ensure that you have the necessary tools and processes in place to gather and analyze the required data.",

Each organization is different and is likely to use the proposed metrics in a different way, and some metrics might be rightfully ignored.

      "answer": "Data anonymization is used to decouple identity from information, making data points unlinkable and hindering the ability of adversaries to make inferences from the data. However, achieving full anonymity is challenging because datasets often contain quasi-identifiers, which are combinations of data attributes that can uniquely identify individuals. These quasi-identifiers allow for re-identification by mapping them to identifying information in other data sources.",
      "evidence": "Anonymisation, as its name indicates, seeks to decouple identity from information. The idea is that removing identifying information from data points makes them unlinkable (i.e., they cannot be grouped as belonging to the same entity), thus hindering the ability of the adversary to perform inferences from the data. However, achieving full Anonymity is extremely difficult. In fact, when a dataset can be declared anonymous remains unclear. Data in and on themselves contain enough information to correlate different attributes and/or records on a database. Given these groups, there are many techniques to re-identify individuals behind the data release. A key insight into understanding the difficulty of anonymisation is the uniqueness of individualâs data patterns. There may be many combinations of the information released in a dataset that are unique to an individual. These are called quasi-identifiers.",

E2EE prevents any third parties, including routers and application servers, from accessing or modifying the data, as only the devices at the ends of the communication have the encryption keys. This encryption method also provides integrity and authentication, securing the identity of the communication parties and preventing data tampering.",
      "evidence": "The protection of data in transit is typically known as end-to-end encryption (E2EE). Here, an end refers to the origin and destination of the communication. For instance, the sender and receiver of an email, or the client and server of a service. E2EE ensures that the Confidentiality of data is ensured between both ends. That is, no third party, from the routers in the communication infrastructure, to the application (e.g., email, messaging) servers that enable the communication, can access the communication. Additionally, E2EE typically provides Integrity, impeding any intermediary from modifying the data exchanged, and Authentication, ensuring that the communication parties can be sure of each othersâ identity.",

Backup and restore procedures should be thoroughly tested. Infrastructure should be maintained with modern software and hardware, kept patched, and end-user devices should be corporately managed. Access controls should be regularly reviewed to ensure appropriateness, and potential routes for account compromise should be constrained. Authorities are advised to avoid sudden changes in infrastructure or service providers during election periods.",
      "evidence": "Electoral systems, in particular electoral management systems (EMS), hold bulk personal datasets. We have published guidance on protecting bulk personal data. We recommend you take regular back-ups of EMS data stores (in particular the electoral roll itself) and hold these offline in a separate secure location. Backup and restore procedures should be well-tested. In the event of problems, ensure the contact details for key suppliers (such as any EMS software and service providers) are readily available. Remember that during an incident, the usual mechanisms for finding contact information may not be available. Infrastructure used by local authorities (and other electoral organisations) should be well maintained, using modern software and hardware, and be kept patched. End user devices, such as those used by staff to manage the electoral roll, should be corporately managed. We recommend using the NCSC Device Security Guidance to help protect these against attack. Depending on the level of access that your operational staff have to electoral systems (and the level of access control within the EMS), they may be able to perform significant privileged actions on EMS data. If so, it may be necessary to consider such staff 'system administrators'. You should constrain potential routes by which their account could become compromised.

For example, some insurance policies will not cover monies lost through business email compromise fraud. This is just one instance where a relatively common incident may not be covered by a standard cyber security policy. If business email compromise (for example) is an issue for you, you'll need to check that your policy covers this. Remember, cyber attacks are evolving all of the time, and you might fall victim to a new type that may not have existed at the time the policy was taken out.

Planning for this ensures that security and productivity are maintained, as VPNs encrypt data in transit and authenticate users, protecting against unauthorized access.",
      "evidence": "Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) allow remote users to securely access your organisation's IT resources, such as email and file services. VPNs create an encrypted network connection that authenticates the user and/or device, and encrypts data in transit between the user and your services. If you are already using a VPN, make sure it is fully patched. Additional licenses, capacity or bandwidth may be required if your organisation normally has a limited number of remote users.",

      "answer": "The NCSC recommends limiting the presence of HRVs in networks, particularly avoiding their use in critical network functions such as IP Core and Security Functions. For 5G networks, a cap of 35% on network traffic volume and base station sites served by HRVs is advised. For 4G networks, a diversification of vendors is encouraged with a 50/50 split. Additionally, operators should not use more than one HRV per network and avoid HRVs near sensitive sites significant to national security.",
      "evidence": "NCSCâs advice is that use of HRVs without these restrictions would cause a cyber security risk that cannot be effectively mitigated. We therefore set out our advice as follows: a. The cyber security risk of using HRVs in the network functions set out below cannot be managed. Therefore, if effective risk management of HRVs is to be undertaken, their products and services should not be used in the following network functions. b. Any use of an HRV in other 5G or FTTP network functions should be limited and we consider that a hard cap of 35% of a network equipment type allows for effective cyber security risk management... c. For 4G and legacy fixed access networks, the NCSCâs advice to operators remains unchanged. Two vendors should always be used in the access network. While no specific volume cap has been recommended, the NCSC has always expected approximately 50/50 split between vendors in a given network.",

Secure communication should be maintained with the proxy, ensuring all connections are protected by protocols like TLS. Outbound connections from proxy connectors should establish secure bidirectional channels, minimizing network perimeter ingress points and reducing the attack surface. Ideally, the proxy should be cloud-hosted as a higher-order offering like SaaS, removing maintenance burdens and facilitating integration with cloud-based identity services. Lastly, it should support access auditing, which helps detect compromised devices and unauthorized access attempts, aligning with zero trust principles.",

Urgency - Are you told you have a limited time to respond (such as 'within 24 hours' or 'immediately')? Criminals often threaten you with fines or other negative consequences. Emotion - Does the message make you panic, fearful, hopeful or curious? Criminals often use threatening language, make false claims of support, or tease you into wanting to find out more. Scarcity - Is the message offering something in short supply, like concert tickets, money or a cure for medical conditions? Fear of missing out on a good deal or opportunity can make you respond quickly. Current events - Are you expecting to see a message like this?

Qualifying organisations will receive around 20 hours of remote support with a Cyber Essentials Assessor. This time will be used to support an organisation in implementing the five Cyber Essentials technical controls, followed by a hands-on technical verification that the controls have been put in place.

That update was the biggest overhaul of the schemeâs technical controls since its launch in 2014. For this reason, we recognised that some organisations might need to make extra efforts when assessed against the new standards, so we offered a grace period of up to 12 months for three of the requirements: any thin clients included in the scope of certification must be supported and receiving security updates, all unsupported software is either removed or segregated from scope via a sub-set, all user accounts on cloud services are protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA).",

The extension allows organizations to align with these updated standards, especially since some might require extra efforts in adjusting their systems to meet requirements such as supporting thin clients, removing or segregating unsupported software, and implementing multi-factor authentication for cloud services. Additionally, this extension coincides with a planned update to the Cyber Essentials technical requirements, which will introduce clarifications and new guidance.",

If it is managed by a third party, discuss the report with them. Avoid forcing the finder to sign documents such as non-disclosure agreement as the individual is simply looking to ensure the vulnerability is fixed. If you need more information to confirm and fix the issue, you should politely request that additional information from the finder. Once you have decided on a course of action, let the finder know that the issue is being managed. You don't need to provide lots of technical information or commit to timescales. If the issue takes time to fix, you should send periodic updates back to the finder. Once the issue is fixed, let the finder know. They might be able to retest the issue to confirm the fix.

Looking after your staff is not only important from an HR perspective - it also directly contributes towards maintaining an organisationÃ¢â¬â¢s security and resilience. Individuals and teams most exposed to the response can quickly become overloaded. Organisations can be more resilient if workloads are more evenly spread across a wider pool of staff, and this also provides development opportunities to less experienced staff. Staff could also be rotated in and out of frontline teams to build sustainability into the total workforce. A period of heightened cyber threat may lead to staff working longer hours and taking fewer breaks. Over an extended period, this could have a negative impact on staff wellbeing and increase the risk of burnout. Ensure that staff spend time away from the office and can also work on other, less pressured tasks. This will provide space for staff to recharge, and boosts organisational resilience.",

Therefore, when using Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), you will need to update the operating systems of any virtual machines and container base images that you manage. For Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), your provider should install these patches for you. The major operating system vendors have produced patches which mitigate the issues, though some parts of the patches need to be installed via the equipment manufacturer (OEM) as they contain platform-specific elements. Software compilers need to be updated to protect applications from the Spectre vulnerabilities.

      "question": "What is lateral movement in the context of network security?",
      "answer": "Lateral movement refers to the actions taken by an attacker who has already gained access to a network and seeks to expand their access to additional systems or data. After the initial compromise, the attacker performs internal reconnaissance to understand the network's structure and location. The attacker then compromises additional hosts, escalates privileges, and ultimately aims to control critical systems or sensitive data.",
      "evidence": "After an attacker has gained an initial foothold in a network, they will typically look to broaden and cement that foothold whilst gaining further access to valuable data or systems. This activity is known as lateral movement. Following the initial compromise of a host, the first step in lateral movement is to perform internal reconnaissance of the network. This gives the attacker an idea of their location within the network, and its overall structure. To solidify their presence and maintain persistence, the attacker will usually try to compromise additional hosts and escalate their privileges, ultimately gaining control of their target (such as a domain controller, a critical system, or sensitive data). Any credentials that the attacker collects will give them (what appears to be) legitimate access to more hosts and servers. Once the goal has been reached, data can be exfiltrated, or systems and devices sabotaged.",

      "answer": "Protecting against lateral movement is crucial because it reduces the risk of attackers successfully reaching their goals after breaching the network. Detecting breaches early and implementing internal security controls can limit the damage an attacker can do once inside the network. Without these protections, attackers can freely move across the network, increasing their chances of achieving their objectives.",
      "evidence": "The security controls advised in the NCSC's Mitigating Malware guidance can reduce the risk of an initial attack succeeding. However, you should assume that an attacker with sufficient time and resources will eventually be successful. It's therefore important to: detect breaches as soon as possible and implement internal security controls to reduce the damage done by an attacker post-breach. Networks with strong boundary protection but no internal security give attackers free rein to traverse the network once they have gained access. The chances of achieving their goals will increase the longer that they're able to maintain a foothold.",

By implementing network security controls and ensuring that internal data and connections are not automatically trusted, segmentation helps restrict unauthorized access.",
      "evidence": "Network segmentation (or segregation), involves splitting up a network into various network segments. This greatly increases the difficulty for an attacker to reach their goal once in the network, as their point of entry may not have any means of reaching the target data or system. Systems and data that do not need to communicate or interact with each other should be separated into different network segments, and only allow users to access a segment where needed. These security controls should ensure that all data and connections originating from within the network boundary are not automatically trusted.",

Consequently: We strongly recommend that PKIs are not shared across communities who would have significantly different security expectations or operational considerations... All devices should ensure the certificates they are relying on are valid. This should be achieved by ensuring they have access to, and use, mechanisms for checking the status of certificates within the PKI - such as Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or via Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).

      "evidence": "We also recommend the following when deploying your services: publish services only using HTTPS, automatically redirect users who visit the HTTP version of your service to the HTTPS version, use the latest versions of TLS libraries and supporting web frameworks; implementation issues can introduce vulnerabilities in the libraries which can quickly be exploited if not patched promptly, follow the guidance on secure application design from Qualys (see section 4 of Qualys - SSL/TLS Deployment Best Practices), enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to help the browser secure connections to your service; one or both of the following steps should be taken: add the Strict-Transport-Security HTTP header when the site is accessed over HTTPS - this instructs the browser to only request the HTTPS version in future (until the expiration time in the header elapses), add your sites to the HSTS preload lists which modern browsers use to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS ( ChromeÃ¢ÂÂs preload list is included in many of the other browsersÃ¢ÂÂ lists), design new applications to use Content Security Policy, as it can be difficult to retrofit later, server certificates should be acquired from trustworthy and reputable sources, publish DNS Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) records to manage which Certificate Authorities will issue certificates for your domain, ensure you have a means of revoking compromised certificates for your services - you should be able to do this through your chosen Certificate Authority (CA), consider advising users if their web browsers are not supporting a sufficient set of TLS algorithms, and providing them with information on how to upgrade their web browser or operating system if appropriate.",

If the connecting party is able to validate that the certificate presented to it is issued by a CA it trusts, then secure communications should be established. It is therefore important to choose a CA that is widely trusted by those likely to connect to your services. If selecting a less common CA, it is possible that the certificates presented by your service may not be able to be validated by the connecting party, and the other party may choose not to continue the session.

      "evidence": "In January, the NCSC announced an update of the Cyber Essentials technical controls. This move was part of a regular review of the scheme to ensure it keeps evolving as the threat landscape and technologies change. That update was the biggest overhaul of the schemeÃ¢â¬â¢s technical controls since its launch in 2014. For this reason, we recognized that some organizations might need to make extra efforts when assessed against the new standards, so we offered a grace period of up to 12 months for three of the requirements: any thin clients included in the scope of certification must be supported and receiving security updates; all unsupported software is either removed or segregated from scope via a sub-set; all user accounts on cloud services are protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA). This grace period was due to end in January. However, the decision has now been made to extend this grace period for a further three months until April 2023.",

      "answer": "Enterprises can ensure their computing platforms are 'secure by default' by focusing on integrating inherent security features into the design of products, systems, or services. This involves making it difficult to render these platforms insecure and managing risks through additional controls. These controls might require user interaction for accessing sensitive data or limiting certain features to reduce the likelihood of compromise. Furthermore, enterprises should aim to shape market demand by showcasing examples, publishing security requirements, and differentiating with independent assurance of the robustness of critical security functions.",
      "evidence": "As the threat from cyberspace increases, the need to adopt the strategy of 'secure by default' becomes more urgent. Often in order to make todayâs products and services secure, their usability has to be severely reduced. If an enterprise is to operate securely in a connected world, every product, system or service that is procured or deployed should be secure by default. It should actually be hard to make them insecure. Managing the risks to modern platforms typically involves adding extra controls; requiring user interaction to access sensitive data, or monitoring/limiting use of some features.",

Using technologies like Near Field Communications (NFC) can simplify user authentication by enabling the use of physical tokens for authentication. Additionally, strong isolation of sensitive data through mechanisms like bare-metal virtualization or Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) can allow safe use of a wider range of applications without compromising security.",
      "evidence": "Users need to securely access a range of services; typically each requires its own authentication credential. Large numbers of tokens or passwords are unwieldy for users; saving details on disk leaves credentials vulnerable to theft from malware. We can use a secure key store such as a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to enable the best of both worlds; authenticate once (when unlocking the device), and securely store credentials for a range of services.

The Smart Metering System uses unique authentication codes for each message and meter, ensuring only authorized entities can communicate with the meter. Additionally, check with your energy supplier to confirm that they are following the recommended security protocols for data communication.",
      "evidence": "Meters have to be brought into the system by the DCC. In general, thatÃ¢â¬â¢s done as part of the commissioning process. Meters have identities inserted into them to show these are real, authorised GB smart meters. These are just normal certificated public/private key pairs, with the DCC holding a register of public keys.",

They will have procedures in place to investigate and address any potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, ensure that your meters are up to date with any security patches or updates provided by the manufacturer or supplier. It's also beneficial to understand the security features of the Smart Metering System, such as message authentication checks, which help protect against unauthorized access.",
      "evidence": "During the design of the system, GCHQ and DECC assumed that vulnerabilities would be found in the various components during the life of the system. This is a reasonable assumption because not everyone who is building things for the Smart Metering System are cyber security experts.",

      "question": "What measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access to smart meters in case of a supplier system compromise?",
      "answer": "The Smart Metering System is designed to prevent unauthorized access through strong authentication and anomaly checking. Each meter uses unique authentication codes for messages, and even if a supplier system is compromised, the attacker can only send valid commands to meters where the supplier has ownership. Furthermore, the DCC employs anomaly checking to detect unusual activity, such as an unexpected number of disconnect commands, and can halt unauthorized actions. The communication infrastructure also limits how many meters can be affected at any given time.",
      "evidence": "ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s a function in the DCC called Ã¢â¬Ëanomaly checkingÃ¢â¬â¢ and it does what it says on the tin - looks for weirdness. In the case of disconnect commands, we donÃ¢â¬â¢t expect many to be sent on a daily basis. So, thereÃ¢â¬â¢s a simple counter in the DCC. If it sees too many disconnects being sent, it just raises an alarm and stops the messages being routed on.",

These cards are available in both English and Welsh and can help school staff understand the importance of cyber security and the steps to improve resilience. For professional use, it's recommended to print the cards using a professional printer on 350 gsm silk, punch holes in the top corner, and bind them together on a keyring. Alternatively, you can choose the cost-effective print-at-home version, which allows you to print the cards on A3 double-sided sheets and fold them into a booklet.",
